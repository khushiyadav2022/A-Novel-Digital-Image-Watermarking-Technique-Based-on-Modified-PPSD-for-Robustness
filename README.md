# A-Novel-Digital-Image-Watermarking-Technique-Based-on-Modified-PPSD-for-Robustness
Â© 2022 IJRAR February 2022, Volume 9, Issue 1

This paper introduces a Robust and Secure Digital Image Watermarking Technique based on Periodic Plus Smooth Decomposition (PPSD), Discrete Wavelet Transform (DWT), and Singular Value Decomposition (SVD). The technique decomposes the host and watermark images into smooth and periodic components, applies SVD to combine the watermark and host images, and obtains the watermarked image through inverse DWT. The proposed technique improves parameters like PSNR, SSIM, and NCC, making it imperceptible and robust against attacks. It also addresses false positive issues through the use of a digital signature for ownership authentication.
